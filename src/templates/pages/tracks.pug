            p The future of journalism is digital. But what does that mean for you as an attendee of hackaburg? Digital journalism is a contemporary form of journalism, in which isnews and features on current affairs, are presented solely or in combination with text, audio, video, or any other interactive form. It’s completely up to you, in which format you provide news or interesting information to the user. Think out of the box and try to develop new ways of  digital journalism.
